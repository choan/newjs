Description:
    The 'newjs_iphone' should only be executed in the root of an Xcode project for an iPhone app that contains a WebKit view.
    
    All assets must be in the Html/src file, and not use sub-folders as Xcode doesn't like them in its Targets.

Example:
    cd my_iphone_project
    newjs_iphone .
